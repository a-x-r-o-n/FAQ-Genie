       - `UiPath.Database.Activities`: For database operations (if using a database).
     - If you need additional packages based on your specific requirements, install those as well.

### **Step 2: Email Monitoring Setup**

1. **Create a Sequence for Email Monitoring:**
   - **Open "Main.xaml":**
     - This is the main workflow file where you’ll set up your process.
   - **Add a Sequence:**
     - Drag a `Sequence` activity from the `Activities` pane into the workflow.
     - Rename the sequence to "Email Monitoring."

2. **Configure Email Retrieval:**
   - **Use `Get IMAP Mail Messages` or `Get Outlook Mail Messages`:**
     - Drag the appropriate email activity into the "Email Monitoring" sequence.
     - **For IMAP:**
       - Set properties such as:
         - `Server`: e.g., `imap.gmail.com`
         - `Port`: e.g., `993` (for secure IMAP)
         - `Email`: Your email address
         - `Password`: Your email account password or an app-specific password.
       - Configure other properties such as `MailFolder` and `Top` as needed.
     - **For Outlook:**
       - Set properties like `MailFolder` and `Top` to retrieve unread messages from the inbox.

3. **Loop Through Emails:**
   - **Add `For Each` Activity:**
     - Drag a `For Each` activity into the sequence.
     - Set the `TypeArgument` to `System.Net.Mail.MailMessage` for IMAP or `System.Net.Mail.MailMessage` for Outlook.
     - Use the output variable from the email retrieval activity (e.g., `mailMessages`) in the `For Each` activity.

### **Step 3: Query Extraction from Emails**

1. **Extract the Query:**
   - **Add an `Assign` Activity:**
     - Inside the `For Each` loop, add an `Assign` activity.
     - Set `emailBody` to `item.Body` to extract the email body text.
     - Example:
       ```plaintext
       emailBody = item.Body
       ```
   - **Use String Manipulation or Regex:**
     - To clean and extract the main query, use `String` functions or `Regex`.
     - **Regex Example:**
       - Use the `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match()` method to extract specific patterns.
       - Example pattern to extract a query: `(?<=\?).*?(?=\.)`
       - Assign the extracted query to `extractedQuery`:
         ```plaintext
         extractedQuery = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(emailBody, "(?<=\?).*?(?=\.)").Value
         ```

2. **Log the Query:**
   - **Add `Log Message` Activity:**
     - Drag a `Log Message` activity into the loop.
     - Set the `Message` property to the `extractedQuery` variable to log the extracted query for debugging.

### **Step 4: Knowledge Base Query**

1. **Check for Predefined Answers:**
   - **Using Excel:**
     - **Use `Read Range` Activity:**
       - Drag the `Read Range` activity to read the Excel knowledge base into a `DataTable`.
       - Configure properties like `WorkbookPath` and `SheetName`.
     - **Loop Through Rows:**
       - Add a `For Each Row` activity to loop through the DataTable.
       - Compare `extractedQuery` with each row’s query column.
       - Example:
         ```plaintext
         If row("Query").ToString.Trim().ToLower() = extractedQuery.Trim().ToLower()
         ```
       - Assign the matched response to `responseText`:
         ```plaintext
         responseText = row("Response").ToString
         ```
     - **Using Database:**
       - **Use `Execute Query` Activity:**
         - Drag the `Execute Query` activity to execute a SQL query that searches for the query.
         - Configure the SQL command and parameters.
       - **Assign the Response:**
         - Check if the query result has rows.
         - Assign the first row’s response to `responseText`:
           ```plaintext
           responseText = queryResult.Rows(0)("Response").ToString
           ```

2. **Log the Matched Response:**
   - **Add `Log Message` Activity:**
     - Use this activity to log the matched response for debugging.

### **Step 5: Generative AI Response (If No Match Found)**

1. **Integrate AI Model:**
   - **Use `HTTP Request` Activity:**
     - Drag the `HTTP Request` activity to send the query to an AI model like OpenAI.
     - Configure properties such as:
       - **Endpoint URL:** e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1/completions`
       - **Headers:** Include authorization (e.g., API key).
       - **Body:** Include the extracted query in the request body.
     - **Parse the JSON Response:**
       - Use `Deserialize JSON` to parse the AI response and extract the generated text.

2. **Log the AI Response:**
   - **Add `Log Message` Activity:**
     - Log the AI-generated response to verify the output.

### **Step 6: Send Response via Email**

1. **Send the Response:**
   - **Use `Send SMTP Mail Message` or `Send Outlook Mail Message`:**
     - Drag the appropriate activity to send the email.
     - Set properties such as `To`, `Subject`, and `Body`.
     - Example:
       ```plaintext
       To = item.From.Address
       Subject = "Your Query Response"
       Body = responseText
       ```

2. **Log the Sent Email:**
   - **Add `Log Message` Activity:**
     - Log a message confirming that the email was sent.

### **Step 7: Escalation Handling**

1. **Check AI Confidence:**
   - **Use `If` Activity:**
     - If the AI model provides a confidence score, check if it’s below a threshold.
     - Example:
       ```plaintext
       If confidenceScore < 70
       ```

2. **Trigger Escalation:**
   - **Use `Send SMTP Mail Message`:**
     - Notify a human operator if the confidence is low.
     - Include the query and AI response details in the email.

   - **Log the Escalation:**
     - Add a `Log Message` activity to record the escalation.

### **Step 8: Final Testing and Deployment**

1. **Test the Workflow:**
   - **Run the Workflow:**
     - Test the workflow end-to-end with sample emails.
     - Ensure that queries are processed correctly and responses are sent.

   - **Debug Issues:**
     - Use breakpoints and debugging tools in UiPath Studio to identify and fix issues.

2. **Deploy the Workflow:**
