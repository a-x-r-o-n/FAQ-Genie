# FAQ-Genie - UiPath Studio Implementation

## Overview
This project is designed to automate the process of responding to frequently asked questions (FAQs) via email. The solution leverages UiPath Studio for workflow automation, integrates with an AI model for generating responses, and uses UiPath Orchestrator for deployment and management.

## Project Setup
### Step 1: Create a New Project
1. Open **UiPath Studio**.
2. Select **New Project** > **Process**.
3. Name the project **FAQ_Response_System**.
4. Choose a save location and click **Create**.

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
1. Open the **Manage Packages** panel.
2. Install the following packages:
   - `UiPath.Mail.Activities`
   - `UiPath.WebAPI.Activities`
   - `UiPath.Database.Activities` (if a database is used)

## Email Monitoring
### Step 1: Create a Sequence for Email Monitoring
1. Open `Main.xaml`.
2. Add a **Sequence** activity and rename it to **Email Monitoring**.

### Step 2: Configure Email Retrieval
1. Use **Get IMAP Mail Messages** or **Get Outlook Mail Messages** to retrieve emails.
2. Configure the necessary properties (e.g., server, port, email, password).

### Step 3: Loop Through Emails
1. Add a **For Each** activity to loop through the retrieved emails.
2. Set the `TypeArgument` to `System.Net.Mail.MailMessage`.

## Query Extraction
### Step 1: Extract the Query
1. Inside the **For Each** loop, use an **Assign** activity:
   ```vb
   emailBody = item.Body
   ```
2. Use string manipulation or regex to extract the query.
   - Example:
   ```vb
   extractedQuery = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(emailBody, "(?<=\?).*?(?=\.)").Value
   ```

### Step 2: Log the Query
1. Add a **Log Message** activity to log the extracted query for debugging.

## Knowledge Base Query
### Option 1: Using Excel
1. Use **Read Range** to load the Excel knowledge base into a DataTable.
2. Add a **For Each Row** activity to loop through the DataTable and match the query.

### Option 2: Using a Database
1. Use **Execute Query** to search the query in the database.
2. Assign the response from the query result.

### Step 3: Log the Matched Response
1. Add a **Log Message** activity to log the matched response.

## Generative AI Response
### Step 1: Integrate AI Model
1. Use **HTTP Request** to send the query to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI).
2. Configure the endpoint URL, headers, and request body.

### Step 2: Parse the AI Response
1. Use **Deserialize JSON** to parse the AI response.
2. Log the AI-generated response for verification.

## Sending the Response
### Step 1: Send the Response
1. Use **Send SMTP Mail Message** or **Send Outlook Mail Message** to send the email response.
2. Set properties such as `To`, `Subject`, and `Body`.

### Step 2: Log the Sent Email
1. Add a **Log Message** activity to confirm that the email was sent.

## Escalation Handling
### Step 1: Check AI Confidence
1. Use an **If** activity to check the AI model's confidence score.
   - Example: `If confidenceScore < 70`

### Step 2: Trigger Escalation
1. Use **Send SMTP Mail Message** to notify a human operator if the confidence is low.
2. Log the escalation for record-keeping.

## Testing and Deployment
### Step 1: Test the Workflow
1. Run the workflow with sample emails to ensure everything works as expected.
2. Debug any issues using UiPath Studio's tools.

### Step 2: Deploy the Workflow
1. Publish the workflow to UiPath Orchestrator for deployment.

## UiPath Orchestrator Setup
### Step 1: Publish and Deploy
1. Navigate to **Jobs** in Orchestrator.
2. Create a new job and assign it to the appropriate robot.

### Step 2: Set Up Triggers (Optional)
1. Configure triggers in Orchestrator to run the job on a schedule or based on specific events.

### Step 3: Monitor and Manage
1. Use Orchestrator's dashboard and logs to monitor job status and troubleshoot issues.

## Continuous Improvement
### Step 1: Analyze Performance
1. Review logs and metrics to identify areas for improvement.
2. Gather user feedback to refine the system.

### Step 2: Update and Republish
1. Make necessary updates in UiPath Studio.
2. Republish the updated workflow to Orchestrator.

### Step 3: Version Control and Documentation
1. Maintain version control and document changes.
2. Ensure that all team members are informed about updates.
